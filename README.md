# Awesome Extralife Tools
A list of tools you can use for interacting with the Extra Life Donor Drive API

To add your tool, make a PR against this repo adding to the readme.md file. I would like to organize it by API-only or End-User and then by programming Language.

## API-Only
### Python
- [DonorDriveAPI](https://github.com/djotaku/DonorDrivePython) - If you would like to create your own program to access the [Donor Drive API](https://github.com/DonorDrive/PublicAPI) you can import this package which already handles the API accesses so you can focus on the UI and user experience.

## End User Programs
### Python
[ELDonationTracker](http://djotaku.github.io/ELDonationTracker/) - If you want either a command line or graphical user interace (GUI) to update your OBS or XSplit streams with notifications when you get donations and also display all sorts of donation information, this is the program for you. 

### Other programming languages?
